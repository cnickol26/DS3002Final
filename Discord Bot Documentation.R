## Discord Bot Documentation

#Reponds to words like help, confused, question, unsure, idk with
# a multitude of responses
#Connected to an external api where it gets random inspirational quotes

## COMMANDS
# $quote will have the bot responds with an inspirational quote
# $new will add whatever follows to the response list for the help words
# $del followed by a number will remove a response from the response list
# $reponding false will turn off the bot responses
# $reponding true will turn back on the bot responses

## Hosted on REPLIT servers
## Set up a ping system on a website called uptime robot that pings my code on REPLIT every 5 minutes
## in order to keep the bot on constantly

## I tried to use other servers but was unable to make anything else work properly
